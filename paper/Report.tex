\section{Background}
Traditional systems-level programming of embedded software, operating systems,
and other low-level applications has been done with language such as C so that
memory and other system components may be managed by the programmer as needed.
With this form of programming also comes the potential for pitfalls that leave
applications ``open to exploits, crashes, or corruption'' 
\cite{klabnik2018rust_book}. With the increasing popularity of Rust, a
systems-level programming language promising safety from the common C / C++
pitfalls, there is now the question of how we might perform some re-write of
critical system software from their potentially insecure C versions to ones
written in Rust \cite{klabnik2018rust_book, emre2021translating}.

One such method of performing a re-write of some codebase is to attempt to
hand-roll a new version of that software by manually translating line-by-line
given C code to Rust code---a method that is time consuming, expensive, and
may lead to there being missing or incorrectly-implemented blocks of code.
Another such approach that has now become far more feasible with the
prevalence and advanced reasoning abilities of \textit{large language models}
(LLMs) is to use those LLMs to perform automatic translation with human
verification.

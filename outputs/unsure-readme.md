// Rust Code Samples

// Please place Rust code samples in this directory. List the files and describe their purpose
// here.

// Files
// - hello.rs: Contains no errors but rather serves as a test file for ChatGPT API queries.
// - race.rs: Contains Rust code with a race condition.
// - malloc_cpy.rs: Contains code which
//   - Does not allocate a properly-sized buffer `buff` (should be `msg.len() + 1`).
//   - Does not check that the buffer `buff` was initialized properly and is not `None`.
//   - Does not free the memory.
// - mysh_ji.rs: Josh's implementation for CSCI 5362 A1.
// - lslong_ji.rs: Josh's implementation for CSCI 5362 A2.
// - prodcon_ji.rs: Josh's implementation for CSCI 5362 A3.
